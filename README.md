Use the jupyter notebook Exp1_DopaEffect15MAR2024.ipynb. Note: The analysis code still needs to be fully updated for this Python version. Please modify that analysis to improve our understanding of memory trace burst dynamics. Also, the experiment is just an example; please explore other parameters. Here, I played around with decreasing the burst duration at baseline to see if ramping up GABA input can still mediate a decrease in burst duration. 

Older verion: DopaEffect7MAR2024_SMS.ipynb. 
The original Model.py is the older version.
